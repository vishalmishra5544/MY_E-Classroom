MY E-Classroom is a is Django based website project which is build with the focus to provide the smooth passage of education from the schools and the colleges to the students whoo are unable to go to their schools or colleges.

Here there are three types of users- Admin(school or college administration), Teachers, Students.

Here our objectives will be to build an online website which will allow its users who are the school/college admins, teachers and the students to participate in the stream of flow of education through the help of internet connectivity. This will help the students who are not in a situation to attend the school or college to access the lessons provided by schools or college.
